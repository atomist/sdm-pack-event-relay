 *
 * Public types require an eventTarget to be set to the ingestion URL.  The event relayer will send these messages
 * via HTTPS to webhook.atomist.com.  You can optionally supply additional headers for public events that will be used
 * when posting data.  Examples of headers you may need to provide would be event type headers or auth information.  If
 * no headers function supplied the purgeCommonHeaders function will automatically be applied
 *
 * Private types are sent over the internal SDM websocket.
